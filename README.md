This repository contains a Tableau-based dashboard project focused on recruitment analytics. It tracks key metrics like 
- total applicants
- selected and joined candidates
- attrition
- average time to join
- average experience

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Provide actionable insights into the recruitment process to improve offer-to-join conversion rates and reduce early attrition.
- **Key Features**:
  - Dynamic visualizations (stacked bar charts, donut charts, tree maps, trend lines)
  - Department-level and recruiter-level performance analysis
  - Monthly recruitment trend analysis
  - Real-time data-driven decision-making

## How to Use

1. **Open the Packaged Workbook**: Download the file [`Tableau_Workbook.twbx`](Tableau_Workbook.twbx) and open it in Tableau Desktop (version 20XX.x or higher).
2. **Explore the Dashboards**: Navigate through the various sheets and dashboards to explore the data and visualizations.
3. **Data Source**: 
   - The underlying data (provided as `sample_recruitment_data.csv` in the `/data` folder) has been anonymized.
   - You can replace it with your own dataset if you wish to replicate the analysis.

## Insights & Results

- **Improved Conversion**: Identified bottlenecks in the recruitment funnel, leading to a ~X% increase in offer-to-join rates.
- **Reduced Attrition**: Highlighted high-risk segments for early attrition and took proactive measures to lower attrition by Y%.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Enabled hiring managers and recruiters to track performance metrics and address issues quickly.

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate with a live data source for automated dashboard refresh.
- Expand to include machine learning predictions for attrition risk.
- Add role-based access controls for different levels of dashboard viewers.
